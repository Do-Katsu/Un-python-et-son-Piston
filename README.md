# Un-python-et-son-Piston
This project simulates the movement of a piston using matplotlib and numpy in python. It aims to show the effect of elastic collisions between molecules of gas and the piston, and how it affects the temperature and volume of the system.
## Installation
To run this project you will need to have matplotlib, numpy and matplotlib.animation library installed in your python environment. You can install them using pip:
```shell
pip install matplotlib 
pip install numpy pip 
install matplotlib.animation
```
## Usage
To run the simulation, you can use the following command in your terminal:
```shell
python un_python_et_son_piston.py
```
This will open a window with the animation of the piston and the molecules of gas. You can change different variables like speed, volume, and number of molecules to see how it affects the temperature and volume of the system.
## Interpretation of results
The simulation assumes that the collisions between the molecules of gas are elastic, therefore no energy is lost and it doesn't affect the system.
The results of the simulation show that the relation between temperature and volume only applies under certain conditions. These conditions are when the speed of the molecules is much higher than the speed of the piston and the number of molecules is very large.
The code also calculates the value of gamma for the system, which is found to be 5/3.
